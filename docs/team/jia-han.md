## Overview of TutHub
TutHub is a desktop app for tech-savvy tuition agents who want to keep track of hundreds of tutorsâ€™ profiles in a more organised and systematic way compared to excel sheets, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
